# move first element, from the left, into sorted list
# make passes over list comparing each element (from L to R) to those in sorted list
# Move items in unsorted list over to the right to make room for sorted element
# Insert them when they are bigger than element before but smaller than element after
# Continue through list for as many elements as there are
